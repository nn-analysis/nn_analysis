# Setup
1. Make a virtual environment with python 3.6.12
2. Install the prednet package, that should install all the dependencies you need to run prednet automatically
3. Download the pretrained weights and the models used for prednet by running the download_models.sh and download_data.sh files in the prednet folder

Note: this version of prednet was altered in order to facilitate the recording of all activations as well as disabling the recurrent connections
